# Honeypot Assignment

**Time spent:** **20** hours spent in total

### MHN-Admin Deployment (Required)

**Summary:** I used GCP in order to create our MHN virtual machine. To accomplish this I first had to go through the process of setting up the firewall configuation. Addtionally after configuring the MHN software to install. After this very lengthy process the MHN Admin deployment was ready for me to move on to the Honeypot to collect data.
